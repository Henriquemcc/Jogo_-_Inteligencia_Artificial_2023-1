# Game - Artificial Intelligence 2023-1

Work on the Artificial Intelligence subject of the Computer Science course at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. In this work, a game should be developed that uses graph search methods.

## Statement

1\) Each group must choose a game to apply at least three search methods below, being the A* search method one of them. Everyone can do the puzzle, for example, without no problem.

a) Breadth-First

b) Deep-First

c) Uniform Cost Search

d) Greedy Search

e) A*

f) MINIMAX

g) etc

2\) I would like to see a report containing explanations about the implemented methods, created heuristics and comparison between the performance of the 3 implemented algorithms. For the same game configuration, which method best solved the problem? Using how long? How many nodes visited etc.

3\) In other words, it is not enough to just implement the game. It is necessary to write a short text explaining each decision. The format of the text must follow the same template as the practical work.

Delivery is the PDF file containing the explanations and the developed code. Please provide an executable.

## Executable

To run this game, simply access [this link](https://henriquemcc.github.io/Jogo_-_Inteligencia_Artificial_2023-1/).

## Report

The report developed is available (in Portuguese) at [Relatório.pdf](Relatório.pdf).
